A script to model referral codes for KOL earnings
Results
Number of referrals = 1000
Referral % on fees earned = 50% 
Log mean trading volume = Approximately ~ $2000/ person [Include Buy + Sell]
Standard Deviation = 1.2 

And yes, if the referral drops to 100, the factor of total earnings is divided by 10. But this assumes once again a pareto principle, where the (80%) of people referred are largely unincentivised to make no more than a total trade volume of $2,000.
